### Contribute to the documentation

Documentation is contained in the docs subdirectory.
In order to develop it locally:

```
pip install mkdocs
pip install pymdown-extensions
```

Then `mkdocs serve` from within DolARK repository.
On a regular basis, latest version is deployed to github pages [pages](http://www.econforge.org/dolARK/) (for now) using `mkdocs gh-deploy`.
